# BetterVote
The framework (and eventual progression) for a new voting aid application that takes into account humans and their beautiful inconsistencies. 

## **The Problem**

A vote compass (VC) has been a toll used to measure difference in political stances for long time. These tools work and they demonstrate which certain party an individual is likely to align with. These VC's are not without fault. The process of creating a coomon VC is fairly simple. On the user end, individuals sit down and answer a few questions and the computer spits out some results. On the programer end, information and questions are formulated and evaulated so that thier eventual solutions can be evaulated and ranked against the other candidates. In any case, programmers are foced to take **absolute** inputs in the form of (yes, no, maybe) and turn them into _relative_ outputs (in the form of a ranking between political parties).

Issue #1: **Humans do not produce absolute inputs/ouputs.**

Ex) If you were to ask a child and a chef about the quality of a piece of chocolate, you are highly likely to get two wildly different responses. Is the child or the chef invalid in their perception of the enjoyment or distaste of the chocolate?


Issue #2: **Vote compasses present relative responses in an absolute form.**

Ex) One child holds a general distaste for chocolate but is ver suprised by this a certain type of chocolate. If the child rates the chocolate as a 10, would you not say that the chocolate holds a "higher" place in ranking in comparison to a child who likes the same chocolate and gives it a 9?


Issue #3: **Vote compasses make attempts to make absolute representations of relative responses.**

Ex) Political stances such as "right-leaning" or "left-leaning" are only relevant in the political landscape that they are taken in. It is like playing a game of hot or cold with no defined/optimal choice. Instead of closing in on the political party that is in closest interest, you end up circling around and around as people and the political landscape changes.

Issue #4: **Questionaries that produce results for Vote Compasses introduce bias.**

Ex) Asking a child "Do you like chocolate?" primes them for a negative or positive response. More often then not, the answer is yes/no/sometimes. If you were to ask a child to rank chocolate in terms of favourability in comparison to other sweets, the ranking would (more often then not) be found near the middle.


## **The Solution**
0. Create a better voting aid application.
1. Focus on ranking only what is given (political statements in this case).
2. present relative data that takes into account the individuals priorities when it comes to attribute selection.
3. Make the data presentable and fun to share (increases changes of health political discourse).

## **The Approach**
Step 1: Learn how to code.
